# Open Door Detection for Safety Using YOLOv7 and YOLOv8

## About
This project aims to enhance safety by detecting open doors in images. Using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models, versions 7 and 8, the system can accurately identify open doors within a dataset of door images. This detection capability can be integrated into various safety systems to help prevent unauthorized access, alert for potential security risks, and support general monitoring of spaces.

## Project Workflow

The project follows these major steps:

1. **Data Collection and Research**: Identifying sources for relevant images, focusing on both open and closed doors across various settings.

2. **Dataset Preparation**: Organizing and structuring the dataset for efficient processing, ensuring that it includes varied angles, lighting conditions, and door types.

3. **Image Annotation**: Labeling each image with annotations to indicate whether doors are open, providing necessary data for training the model.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training the YOLOv7 model on the prepared dataset, evaluating its performance, and tuning it to maximize accuracy in detecting open doors.

5. **Testing and Optimization**: Testing the trained model on new images to verify accuracy, adjusting model parameters as needed, and refining detection precision.

6. **Training with YOLOv8**: Conducting additional training with YOLOv8 for comparative performance analysis and potential improvements in detection accuracy and speed.
